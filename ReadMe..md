# Big data for happiness
The idea is to collect data from people through their mobile phone using an app. The person who is configuring the app eventually is in therapy or attending councelling sessions because of certain disorders. The data collected and analysis shall help the person to identify areas, where simply the change of habits and behaviour can already have a positive impact on his/her situation.
